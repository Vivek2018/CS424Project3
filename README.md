# CS424Project3

No changes were made to the dataset, so to run this instead of shinyapps, just download and open the r project in the repo and it should open and you can click run app.


FIXING THE VARIABLE ISSUE:

Rename the "results" variable at line 186 to "return_set" and everything should work if not corrected already with the Professor's permission. Thank you!
